                    <h2 class="subtitle">How Does Teeth Whitening Work?</h2>
                    <p>Teeth whitening generally occurs when the whitening gel is exposed to the dentine of a
                        Tooth (found directly under the enamel). When the gel penetrates through the enamel,
                        Pigmentation found in the dentinal tube oxidizes, rendering a white finish, which is
                        Reflected through the translucent enamel.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Traditional teeth whitening systems incorporate the use of a heat lamp or similar
                        Product, to accelerate the oxidization process. The downside of this treatment method
                        Is that the use of heat as an accelerant causes a host of adverse symptoms, including,
                        Itching and skin irritation, gum irritation, mild to severe burning, sunburn and
                        Exposure to harmful uv radiation.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The crystal teeth whitening system overcomes these harmful effects by using a beam of
                        High intensity light, which is filtered through over 12,000 optical fibres. The light is
                        Finally filtered through two optical lenses, which have over 30 layers of coated optical
                        Glass. The cold light, illuminates teeth at a wavelength of 430 -490 nanometers, which is
                        Proven to be the optimal range for teeth whitening.<br/><br/>
                        Harmful ultra-violet (uv) light is completely removed from the filtering system, leaving
                        Only a focused beam of cold light in the blue-cyan spectrum. This penetrates deep into
                        The teeth, enabling oxidization to occur without any of the harmful side-effects and
                        Zero senitivity.</p>
