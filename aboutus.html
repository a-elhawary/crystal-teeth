                        Each individual contains different mineral content within the teeth, staining varies, and

                        Your specific needs and desires. We feel that individually tailored treatments should be
                        Determined after a consultation and during the process depending on how the teeth
                        Are reacting to the treatment, considering the individual’s wishes.<br/><br/>

                        Fully qualified dental professionals<br/><br/>

                        When fully qualified and experienced dental professionals undertake the procedure.
                        While other competitor teeth whitening companies use non-dental trained staff or only
                        Technicians.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Crystal teeth company believes that because not all customers are clinically suitable
                        For light teeth whitening, the treatment should only be performed by dental
                        Professionals, who have successfully undergone many years of training within their
                        Profession.
